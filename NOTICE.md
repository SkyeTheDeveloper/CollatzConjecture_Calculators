## Project Description

This project contains multiple implementations of Collatz Conjecture calculators
across various programming languages, demonstrating both 64-bit precision and
arbitrary precision integer arithmetic techniques.

## Implementations Included

### 64-bit Precision Implementations:
- **C Implementation**: Uses native uint64_t datatype with overflow checking

### Arbitrary Precision Implementations:
- **C# Implementation**: Uses native BigInteger library
- **Go Implementation**: Uses math/big library
- **Java Implementation**: Uses native BigInteger library
- **Kotlin Implementation**: Uses Java's BigInteger library
- **Python Implementation**: Uses native int datatype
- **Ruby Implementation**: Uses native integer datatype

## Third-Party Components

This project utilizes standard libraries and built-in datatypes from the respective
programming languages. No external third-party dependencies are required.
